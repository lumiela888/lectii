SEO - Search Engine Optimization
Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking (visibility) of a website in search engines.
The higher (or more frequently) a web site is displayed in a search engine list (like Google), the more visitors it is expected to receive.
Luckily most search engines invites you to submit your site: *

Bing: http://www.bing.com/webmaster/SubmitSitePage.aspx
